A lot of emojis are available (https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) use with professional discretion :smirk:

It is possible to mention other github users (for example, if you collaborated with another team or used a package and want to give credit) 
We would like to thank @github/support for helping us with the data formating  

Footnotes are also available as follows: 


Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
